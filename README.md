# Unity 3D Menu Tools
_____________________________________________________________

A complete set of first-class Unity3D menu tools. These scripts jump-start rapid prototyping applications made with Unity.

There are 3 major components in this system:
  1. PageManager.cs
  2. PageController.cs
  3. ButtonEvent.cs
  
 Together, these components provide everything you need to create robust menu systems with page transitions and button animations. A good bit of work has been done ensure page integrity when switching between pages, and simplifying the process of creating buttons that do exactly what you want them to do. I'll describe in detail what each component offers below.
